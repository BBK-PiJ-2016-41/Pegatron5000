<p>The application will ask you how many pegs you want to play with. To change the number of turns, update the private val turns in GameImpl.</p>
<p>To add more colours for the pegs, add a new class extended from the Colour interface inside the 'Colours' folder. The class name needs to be the first letter of the colour (eg. 'M' for Maroon)
followed by the word 'colour', so Maroon's class name would be "Mcolour"</p>
